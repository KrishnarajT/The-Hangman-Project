By far the project that I have worked on the most, I liked the idea, so I wanted to learn to handle bigger and bigger files. Its another great build. Lot of hard work involved, but lesser smart work though, something worth regretting. 

# Idea
The idea was simple. This was made during the Infinity war hype, and so was clearly influenced by how cool it would be to have a character die instead of body parts of a hangman. As I didnt know how to add video files in C++, I exported frames of the actual movie, and played them real quick like a gif. (Yet another idea that didnt dawn on me at the time). 

The Themes include
1. Marvel
2. John Wick
3. Harry Potter
4. Classic

So there are heartbreaking scenes from all these movies that get played each time you mis guess a character. 

# Installation
To run this you can just download this repository and run HangMan.exe.
